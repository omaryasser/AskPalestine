I'm very reluctant to condemn people who are in a position or in a condition such that were I in that position or condition I'm not sure what I would do now the 1500 young men who burst the gates of Gaza they were born into a concentration camp they lived for two decades in a concentration camp they had no past they had no present they had no future they had no jobs half of them according to humanitarian organizations suffered from what's called severe food insecurity and then on top of that Israel goes into Gaza and it [mows the lawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowing_the_lawn) and what mows the lawn means is a massacre in Gaza in 2008-2009 [Operation Cast Lead](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009)>), in 2012 [Operation Pillar of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Israeli_operation_in_the_Gaza_Strip), in 2014 [Operation Protective Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War) and on each of these high tech massacres visited on the people of Gaza in some cases hundreds in some cases thousands of Palestinians are killed.

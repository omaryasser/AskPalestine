As a Muslim, I don't believe in the killing of any man or woman or children. That's not despite the religious teachings. That's because of the religious teachings. I condemn not only Hamas but any other entity wherein it's proven that the killing of combatants has been made and therein I condemn any party that kills people or strikes at people where it's more probable than not that it will hit a civilian target I condemn them and that's why I condemn the IDF because when they strike they know that it's more probably than not it's going to hit civilian targets. They know that the majority of civilians or the majority of people who are going to be affected are civilians. We know that from the various operations that have been conducted. We know that because now in Gaza you find that there is a blockage as you know for 17 years but also they are stopping the electricity and water which is a war crime under the Geneva Convention protocol.

**Short:** This question, as well as saying "but Hamas", whether intended to or not, ends up being used to justify treating all Palestinians as terrorists. It is an extremely unfair and unhelpful question to ask. It also overlooks the long-standing struggles of Palestinians and the fact Hamas emerged to fight for the human rights of Palestinians as a result of a 75-year-long ethnic cleansing. Blaming all Palestinians for Hamas also ignores their fight for freedom and forces them as oppressed people, currently experiencing mass death, into a cycle of endless fault-finding that overlooks the root cause of the problem. It is also detrimental to your learning process, and in moving towards a solution.

The questions you should be asking are: why aren't Israelis asked to condemn the actions of Israel before being given a voice? Why are Jews allowed to be scared but not Muslims? Why are white people entitled to feel fear but not Arabs? Being asked to condemn Hamas distracts you from the urgent reality of ongoing Palestinian suffering and the need for meaningful action to help both the Palestinian people and Israeli hostages.

**Long:** This question, as well as saying "but Hamas", whether intended to or not, end up being used to justify treating all Palestinians as terrorists. It is an extremely unfair and unhelpful question to ask.  People want Palestinians to condemn Hamas before even discussing the horrors they've been facing for 75 years. It's important to remember that Hamas came about only in the past 17 years and as a result of the violence Palestinians have been subjected to by the occupation. Hamas and potentially new resistance groups will continue to exist and grow unless there is global support in first liberating the Palestinian people.

Secondly, blaming all Palestinians for what Hamas does makes it easy to dismiss their struggle for freedom. Unlike Israeli officials who don't have to condemn their documented, proudly admitted to, genocidal actions before being allowed to speak - Palestinians are forced to condemn Hamas first. This puts Palestinians in a wildly unfair position. No matter what they or anyone else says, it's never enough. It is also detrimental to your learning process, and in moving towards a solution. The questions you should be asking are: why aren't Israelis asked to condemn the actions of Israel before being given a voice? Why are Jews allowed to be scared but not Muslims? Why are white people entitled to feel fear but not Arabs? 

This focus on condemning Hamas distracts you from the real issue â€“ the occupation and suffering of Palestine and its people. And by addressing questions such as these, instead of talking about any other part of what is currently happening right now, we are just repeating empty phrases that can neither bring the 1,200 Israelis or 20,000 Palestinians back to life.

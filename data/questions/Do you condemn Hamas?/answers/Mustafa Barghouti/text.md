[Dr. Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti) said in [this](https://youtu.be/Gjgb2faf3FQ?si=hmu4UQSyoF1De-QW&t=116) video:

Do you condemn that Israel has been occupying us since 1967? Do you condemn that Israel has been practising ethnic cleansing against Palestinian people for 75 years? Do you condemn that Israel has evicted 70% of the Palestinian people from their land, erasing to the ground 520 Palestinian towns and Villages? Condemn that and then I'll answer. Until you condemn the atrocities that are happening in Gaza; three war crimes, the war crime of ethnic cleansing. I am a person of nonviolence. I never accept the killing of any child whether Palestinian or Israeli. I don't accept the killing of the 30 children they say were killed on the 7th of October, but you should also agree with me that you do not agree with killing 12,000 Palestinian children! 12,000! Do you know what that means? children were killed by Israeli bombardment and they have been occupying us since 1967.

I condemn the genocidal conditions that created this violence. Every human heartbeat is sacred to me, We don't have a clear picture of what happened on October 7th because unfortunately too much of the media has relied on the Israeli military talking points which are given directly to them. Until you show observers that are able to establish the facts of October 7th, I will not allow the talking points of the Israeli military to become dominant of what happened on that day. The Palestinians are subject to genocidal war, a collective punishment in Gaza is real.

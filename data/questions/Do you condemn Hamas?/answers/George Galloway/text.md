[George Galloway](https://askpalestine.info/users/George%20Galloway) answered this in [this](https://youtu.be/IIHtjH6UkBk?si=OVRLo68dTlsqyne2&t=648) video, saying:

I was underground as an undercover agent of the [ANC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress). I was working for Nelson Mandela's ANC. I gave my blood on the floor of the Gugulethu police station in Cape Town. Was the ANC a terrorist organization? the answer is no, even though they had people who carried out terrorist attacks. You have to understand the whole picture and not just a tiny corner of a single snapshot. The Palestinians are fighting against an apartheid state for the millions of Palestinians scattered around the world with no one speaking up for them. If you are fighting against occupation forces undoubtedly it is resistance. It was David Cameron I remind you who called it the largest open-air prison camp in the world. If you break through that and you start taking a toll on the guards, the people who've kept you in this absolute misery with regular death being dealt to you, then that's a legitimate act of resistance.

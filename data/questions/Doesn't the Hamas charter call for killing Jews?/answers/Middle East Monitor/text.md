The following is mentioned in the Hamas charter published by the Middle East Monitor:

- Article 16 of Hamas’ 2017 charter states that “Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine. Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity.”

- The Hamas charter of 2017 emphasizes that Islam “provides an umbrella for the followers of other creeds and religions who can practice their beliefs in security and safety. Hamas also believes that Palestine has always been and will always be a model of coexistence, tolerance and civilizational innovation.” Hamas calls for the resistance of military occupation, a right sanctioned under UN General Assembly resolution 37/43 of 1982.

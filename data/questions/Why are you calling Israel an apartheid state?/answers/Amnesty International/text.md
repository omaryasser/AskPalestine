Amnesty International mentioned in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoFjbnvkmQ0) video:

- In 1948 when [Ben Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion) visited Lifta and other areas near Jerusalem that were completely emptied from their Palestinian residents following attacks of Jewish forces he [stated](https://www.progressiveisrael.org/ben-gurions-notorious-quotes-their-polemical-uses-abuses/#:~:text=there%20are%20no,in%20the%20country) “There are no Arabs. One hundred percent Jews… If we persist it is quite possible that in the next six or eight months, there will be considerable changes in the country, very considerable and to our advantage”.

- Benjamin Netanyahu posted on Instagram [that](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/11/702264118/netanyahu-says-israel-is-nation-state-of-the-jewish-people-and-them-alone) Israel is not a state of all its citizens, but rather “the nation of all Jewish people and only them.”

- In Jerusalem the Israeli official policy is to maintain at least 60% Jewish majority.

- The fragmentation of the Palestinian society and the dispossession of their land are key pillars of Israel's apartheid system to maintain domination and control.

- The unequal structure of nationality and status, restrictions on freedom of movement, use of military rule, denial of the right to political participation or the right to peaceful protest and cruel separation of families all add to the complex system that we see today.

- Jewish Israelis have only one ID card with a status that grants them the right to live almost anywhere they wish in the country. They can move freely with access to health care and vast resources. Palestinians on the other hand have 4 types of ID cards if any at all. The type of ID card you’re given determines the level of rights you can enjoy and controls where you can go and what you can do.

- To make sure Palestinian communities can’t develop any further, Israel has made it almost impossible to grant building permits for Palestinian homes.
  In 2020 issued 1,094 building permits for Jewish Israelis and only 1 for Palestinians.

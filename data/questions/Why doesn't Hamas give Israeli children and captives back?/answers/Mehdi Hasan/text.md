**First**, for everyone who believes that Benjamin Netanyahu and his government of far-right fascists and racists are fighting their war in Gaza in order to rescue the hostages, how do they explain the fact that Netanyahu had a chance to bring all of the civilian hostages home right at the very beginning? It's [the view](https://www.timesofisrael.com/no-doubt-netanyahu-preventing-hostage-deal-charges-ex-spokesman-of-families-forum/) of Rubinstein who was a spokesman for the families of the Israeli hostages and said "we learn that Hamas offered on October 9th or 10th to release all the captive civilians in its hands if the IDF did not enter the Gaza Strip but the government rejected the offer". In fact, the Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/26/israel-gaza-war-hamas-civilians/) on a similar proposal at the end of October saying "Hamas was proposing to release all foreign civilian hostages in exchange for a 5-day ceasefire Israeli civilian hostages would be released if additional demands were met including the release of Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons and the opening of the Rafah border crossing".

**Second**, Israeli officials have said time and again that the war won't end until Hamas is destroyed regardless of whether the hostages are released. Smortich, Israel's Finance Minister, made clear that [he was opposed](https://twitter.com/kann_news/status/1785298974619861022) to any hostage release deal that stopped Israel from going into Rafah now you might say that's just smoke TR he's not in charge well prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said this week that he would invade Rafah with or without a deal on the hostages.

**Third**, the hostages at the core of this conflict at the heart of this current round of killing and violence aren't just Israelis, they're Palestinians too because while we're all aware of the fact that around 250 hostages were taken from Israel by Hamas and other armed groups on October the 7th including, shamefully, children and around 130 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza we don't really mention the thousands of Palestinians who have been rounded up detained held without trial tortured sexually abused without any charges let alone any convictions in Israeli prisons and I'm not even talking about just since October the 7th I'm talking about before October the 7th.

When the bad faith apologists for Israel pop up on TV or online to justify that violence and to robotically and cynically repeat "what about the hostages" ignoring all of the three things that I just pointed out to you, treat that dishonest refrain with the contempt it deserves.

[Dr. Omar Suleiman](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/team/omar-suleiman) explained in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0G8II_7f7k) video:

The prophet, peace be upon him, said that the first person to be judged on the day of judgment will be a Shahid, a martyr who is brought forth in front of Allah. Allah will mention his blessings, his favours upon that person, and the person will acknowledge all of those blessings. Then, Allah will say what did you do with those blessings? He would say that I fought in your cause until I lost my life. Allah would say you have lied. Rather, you fought so that people would say what a brave man you are, what a courageous man you are. You wanted that to be said and it was said. In this Hadith, the Prophet also mentions a scholar who only taught or who only recited the Quran so people would praise their recitation or their knowledge.

There are five things that the scholars mention:
* **A sign is a person who doesn't renew their intentions.** We're a religion where we are taught to renew our intentions every single day every single morning before every single act of worship.
* **If the only time you do good work is when other people see it then that's a sign.**
* **If you're disappointed when you're not celebrated.**
* **That you quit when you're attacked.**
* **That you walk when everybody else walks away.** Things capture our attention and everybody gets excited about a noble cause and then eventually attention moves on. Our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter and shorter. There are going to be people that are going to look around and say no one's talking about this anymore no one's posting about it anymore no one's protesting anymore no one's praying about it anymore no one's giving to it anymore I guess we can all move on now.

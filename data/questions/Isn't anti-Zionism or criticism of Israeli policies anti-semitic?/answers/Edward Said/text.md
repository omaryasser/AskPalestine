Israel was constructed on the ruins of another society and by the mass dispossession of another people who remain unacknowledged as just sort of obscure natives in the background, back to the desert, let them let them go to one of the other Arab countries; that's been the position. The Oslo Accord say specifically that Israel bears no responsibility for the costs of the occupation. This after years of military occupation? As an Israeli journalist said: *We took over the country in 1948 from the British. The British left us the port of Haifa, a road system, an electrical system, a large number of municipal buildings, and lots of prisons. If we had taken Palestine in 1948 the way we left Gaza for the Palestinians, there would be no Israel. We destroyed the economy, we deported most of the capable people, we forced the people to live in refugee camps*  and they bear no responsibility for it; that's simply unacceptable; even for the Jewish people who have suffered so much, it's unacceptable you cannot continue to victimize somebody else just because you yourself were a victim once, there has to be a limit.

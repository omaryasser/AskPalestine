[Mehdi Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Hasan) said in [this](https://youtu.be/K1VTt_THL4A?si=0PvySDMB9wvFqGW7&t=2171) video which was discussing whether Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism:

Let's be clear about what this motion is. The motion says "Anti-zionism is anti-semitism". It doesn't say some anti-zionists are anti-semites which is true, it doesn't say anti-zionism can sometimes turn into anti-semitism which is true, it doesn't say that anti-semites often use anti-zionism as cover as an excuse for their bigotry and racism which is true. I wouldn't oppose any of that but that's not what the motion says. The motion says, ridiculously sweepingly offensively ahistorically, that anti-zionism is anti-semitism that merely being opposed to zionism as a political ideology is inherently by definition: ant-semitic which is absurd think about the implications of voting for that tonight you'd be saying every anti-zionist every anti-zionist is a bigot a racist and an anti-semite.

By definition, even the many Jewish and Israeli anti-zionists so [Ilan Papp√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9), a Jewish historian born and raised in Israel, served in the Israeli military, he's an anti-semite that's what they want you to believe. So is the former speaker of Israel's own parliament the Knesset [Avraham Burg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg) melody, they would say he's a self-hating jew so is my The Intercept colleague [Naomi Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein#Criticism_of_Israel) the acclaimed author and climate change activist so is [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) he's an anti-semite as well. They want you to vote for them and say that the thousands of Haredi ultra-orthodox anti-zionist Jews who oppose Zionism for religious theological reasons they're anti-semites too that's what they want. Don't take my word for it listen to the [35 top Israeli Jewish scholars](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/israelis-warn-against-equating-anti-zionism-with-anti-semitism/) and academics historians of the holocaust who came together and published an open letter in which they wrote: "many victims of the holocaust opposed Zionism, on the other hand, many anti-semites supported Zionism it is nonsensical and inappropriate to identify anti-zionism with anti-semitism". are they anti-semites too really all 35 of them by the way in terms of the history they refer to in their letter it is an undeniable indisputable fact that many many European anti-semites did support Zionism at the outset they did embrace the founder of Zionism [Theodor Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl) because, for their own selfish racist reasons, they shared his goal of treating Jews as a foreign separate nation and getting them out of Europe take British foreign secretary [Arthur Balfour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour) author of the 1917 Balfour declaration. In favour of Zionism, Balfour dismissed jews as "an alien and hostile people". He sponsored legislation to keep Jewish refugees out of the UK. The only Jewish member of the cabinet at that time [Edwin Samuel Montagu](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zionism-anti-semitism-and-balfour-declaration/) opposed the Balfour declaration and called Zionism a mischievous political creed yet apparently according to the proposition tonight Montague's the anti-semite and Balfour isn't.

We've heard tonight that it's anti-semitic to suggest Israel is born in sin. Every black American I know says to me and says to everyone else that the United States were born in sin slavery was a sin at the start of the United States no one accuses them of being anti-white racist or anti-american racist it's just a statement of historical fact they say the proposition that when you oppose Zionism you're denying Jews and no one else a right to self-determination which is just flat false not every nation or ethnic group wants a state gets a state.

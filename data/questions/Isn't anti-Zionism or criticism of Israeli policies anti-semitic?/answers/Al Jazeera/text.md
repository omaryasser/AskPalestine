[Al Jazeera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera) mentions in [this](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/2/from-the-river-to-the-sea-what-does-the-palestinian-slogan-really-mean) article:

* To Palestinian and Israeli observers alike, different interpretations over the meaning of the slogan hang on the term “free”. Nimer Sultany, a lecturer in law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, said the adjective expresses “the need for equality for all inhabitants of historic Palestine”.
* Freedom here refers to the fact that Palestinians have been denied the realisation of their right to self-determination since Britain granted the Jews the right to establish a national homeland in Palestine through the Balfour Declaration of 1917.
* Sultany, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, said "It’s important to remember this chant is in English and it doesn’t rhyme in Arabic, it is used in demonstrations in Western countries. The controversy has been fabricated to prevent solidarity in the West with the Palestinians."
* According to the Jewish Virtual Library, the party’s original party manifesto in 1977 stated that “between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty”. It also argued that the establishment of a Palestinian state “jeopardises the security of the Jewish population” and “endangers the existence of the state of Israel”.
* Israel’s ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, has been among the promoters of international recognition of the Jewish historic claim to lands from the river to the sea.

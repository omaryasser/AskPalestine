[Dr. Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti) said in [this](https://youtu.be/F6_cheSL29I?si=IGXU8J60gOeOkWEG&t=2495) video:

The US and Britain created Israel. They created it to be the base of imperialist and colonial interests in the region. They created it to preserve American interests in the region. They also created it to be a threat force to the surrounding countries in the region. Their goals are: control of oil, control of energy resources, and control of the strategic location. Israel, for them, was the best ally. At the beginning, they claimed that they were doing this to confront the Soviet Union and the other countries. Today, they want to impose it as a method for economic, strategic, and political control.

Israel was established on the basis of Balfour's agreement which Britain issued in 1917. But Balfour's agreement is not excluded from the American-Anglican movement which supported this approach. They even used Jewish mythology to justify the establishment of the State of Israel in this way. Therefore, the relationship between the US and Israel is an organic relationship, not a temporary alliance relationship. Because they look at it as two sides: The first side is that it is a base to preserve their military, political, and strategic interests. Secondly, they consider it a project of occupation and settlement to take over the place of the Palestinians and take their land.

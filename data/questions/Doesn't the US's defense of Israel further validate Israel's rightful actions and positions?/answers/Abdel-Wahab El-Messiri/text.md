The origin of this movement was that Europe was beginning to think of this Zionist thinking on two levels. The first level is that the imperialist solution for all Europe's problems is by exporting these problems abroad, just as they exported criminals, religious protesters, and so on, and exported social failures, so the Jews had to be exported. At this stage, the search was for any offer from Mozambique, Argentina, or Al-Arish, but what happened was that the Jewish issue coincided with the Ottoman issue. The Ottoman issue was that Europe decided to divide the Ottoman Empire, and found it necessary to create a settlement state in this place. Through the marriage of the imperialist solution to the Jewish question and the imperialist solution, Palestine was determined as the place of Jewish settlement. This arose again in colonial circles before it arose among the Jews.

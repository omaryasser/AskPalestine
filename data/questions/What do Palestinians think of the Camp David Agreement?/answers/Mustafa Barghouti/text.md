[Dr. Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti) said in [this](https://youtu.be/F6_cheSL29I?si=BA9SGjA13Fb0Kciw&t=1745) video:

What was proposed in Camp David was just talking about an independent government. The terms were not clear and do not forget who was leading Israel at that time, Menachem Begin, one of the most far extremists. And all the story of Camp David was a kind of trade. One of its main points is to give up on the Palestinian side. Therefore, the Palestinians saw in it a sad exit for Egypt from the battlefield with Israel. Therefore, of course, there was an objection to the Camp David Agreement at that time, a big objection.

I think that if we go back in history, it was better for the Arabs and the Palestinians to stay with us in one line and not to allow Israel to separate them one by one.

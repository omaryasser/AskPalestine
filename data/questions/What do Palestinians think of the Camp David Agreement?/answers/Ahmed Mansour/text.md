[Ahmed Mansour](https://www.askpalestine.info/users/Ahmed%20Mansour) mentioned the following sayings in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uq_b-0Gp3Q) video:

* The Camp David Accords, which President Anwar Sadat signed with the Israelis, will remain a milestone in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict because, in short, it gave the Israelis the right to usurp Palestinian lands.
* Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Hamas movement, says about the agreement: It is the beginning of the Arab retreat in the face of the Israeli settlement attack, and the days have proven that it is so, and it has torn apart Arab unity and the Arab wall as for Israel.
* Lieutenant General Saad Al-Shazly says about the agreement: What peace? Peace must be between two rivals and there must be a concession from both parties. But Sinai is still demilitarized, and we are not allowed to have aircraft or a military airport inside Sinai or missile air defense.

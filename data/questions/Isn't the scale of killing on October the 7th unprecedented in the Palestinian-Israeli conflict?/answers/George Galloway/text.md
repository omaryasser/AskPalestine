[George Galloway](https://askpalestine.info/users/George%20Galloway) responded to that question in [this](https://youtu.be/IIHtjH6UkBk?si=8JPBx7yi-0hN8Gun&t=402) video by saying:

It was by no means the single biggest slaughter in the Israel-Palestine chapter. In fact, in five hours, with Sharon on the roof, shining a searchlight into the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut. 3,850 Palestinian women and children. There were only women and children because the men had all agreed to sail away to Tunisia as part of an American broker deal. Now, younger viewers will not remember Sabra and Shatila, but those two names are burned in the minds of those older and who care about it. So thatâ€™s triple the actual death toll on October the 7th. The fact that you thought, I mean, disrespectfully, that this was the biggest single day of slaughter is part of the problem. The blood of Palestinians is oftentimes by commentators and politicians regarded as less valuable than the blood of Israelis. All the blood is a disgrace, all of it.

As the superior power, and with the help of the US, Israel signed an inequitable peace accord with the Palestinians in 1993. Despite its unfairness, the Palestinians accepted everything that the Israelis and US dictated (including being allowed to inhabit only 22% of historical Palestine), whilst Israel did not concede anything in return. It did not withdraw from the occupied territories, did not allow the return of refugees, and did not accept the substantive human right of self-determination for the Palestinians. It only furthered its takeover and occupation of Palestine. Since 1993 Israel has multiplied its illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank, expropriated land and water resources, added more than 500 checkpoints, imprisoned and tortured thousands of Palestinians including children without a trial process, and taken every step to deny the Palestinians their statehood. This behaviour obviously raises questions about the sincerity of these ‘generous offers’, and proves that Israel has always had clear ulterior motives in their dealings with Palestine. Even in this current genocide, Hamas has been willing to work on coming towards an agreement regarding a ceasefire deal. It has been Israel who has rejected the deal on multiple occasions. The ceasefire deal that was reached weeks ago and lasted for a number of days, was the exact same deal that Hamas had presented Israel some weeks prior, and Israel rejected at the time. It is abundantly clear that Hamas/Palestine is not the issue here, as well as it is clear where Israel’s interests lie - and it is not even with their own people.

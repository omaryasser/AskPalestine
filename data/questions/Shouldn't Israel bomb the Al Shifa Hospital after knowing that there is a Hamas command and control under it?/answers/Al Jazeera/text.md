The Israeli Army has accused Hamas of using hospitals as a convenient cover for its Fighters and an elaborate system of tunnels. On November 5th, the Israeli Army published a video on X that claims to reveal the entrance to a tunnel used by Hamas Fighters. After further analysis, our digital investigations team found that this structure is nothing more than a water reservoir. To further verify its finding, the team tracked down one of the original Engineers who worked on the construction of the Hospital by cross-referencing his diagram with the images in the video released by the Israeli Army our digital investigations team was able to clearly identify that pressure equalisation pipe commonly used for water and fuel tanks or reservoirs. Its conclusion is that the only thing this video confirms is that there is a water tank on the property, not a tunnel used by Hamas Fighters.

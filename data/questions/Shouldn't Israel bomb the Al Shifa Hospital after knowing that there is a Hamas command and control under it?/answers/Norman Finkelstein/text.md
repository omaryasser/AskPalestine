So Israel is presenting all of these very sophisticated images to prove that there is a Hamas command and control centre under Al Shifa hospital and in every military operation they target Al Shifa. There's a very simple way to answer that question. there are 60,000 people in Alshifa Hospital. You just send an inspector. Show us where the command and control centre is.

So you know exactly where they are! Let's see it. Nobody even asks the question. Why aren't they just sending in inspectors to check whether the hospital is used as a command centre? Because everybody knows. It's nonsense.

**Why canâ€™t I rely on news from sources like the BBC, ABC, New York Times, The Guardian etc?**

Due to the billions of dollars spent by the Israeli government on marketing and the spreading of propaganda and misinformation, not only is it misguided to suggest that people seek out information from the news sources cited above, but actively harmful. These organisations are notoriously Zionist and anti-Palestine, backed and funded by the West and Israel, some even owned by Zionists. So, they feed the imperialist propaganda machine. There are several independent news sources reporting real-time, on-the-ground information that is integral to 'uncomplicating' a lot of the confusion people are having around this issue such as the following:

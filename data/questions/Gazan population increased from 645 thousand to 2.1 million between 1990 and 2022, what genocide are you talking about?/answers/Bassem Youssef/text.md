Do you know why they increased? You would say "Because they are having babies like crazy". No, this is how you look stupid when you talk data while being uninformed. The reason behind this 1.5 million increase didn't come from Gaza; it was pushed to Gaza from other parts of Israel to put those people in the largest open-air prison. So most of this increase is because of refugees being kicked out. My wife's family is not from Gaza and yet they found themselves in Gaza because they were sitting in other cities and villages outside Gaza. This is the systemic pushing of people from other parts of Israel to Gaza. The people who belong to Gaza are 700 thousand people. The 2.5 million is not the birth rate; these are people pushed to Gaza. That's not the first time, in 1948, on the night of the declaration of the state of Israel, 1.5 million Palestinians were moved outside.

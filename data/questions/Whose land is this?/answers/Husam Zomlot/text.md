Let me explain this! Many people around the world believe that the two-state solution is a Palestinian demand. No, it's not. The two-state solution is a Palestinian concession because by the late 80s, the PLO was proposing one Democratic egalitarian state for all of its citizens be it Muslim be it Christian be it Jewish that was our political platform. But the world (i.e. the West-led world), primarily, the US proposed something else. They said no, we have to divide the land (i.e. The two-state Solution). By the late 80s, Yasser Arafat and the founders of the movement decided to Ally themselves with International resolutions and therefore we accepted the two-state solution, not as our demand, but as our compromise. Now here is the deal! We cannot accept less than the than the 1967 borders.

Israel keeps negotiating with us, not about how to achieve the 67 borders, no no, they want to arrive somewhere between Jerusalem and Jericho. So they want to bite more of the 22% of historic Palestine that is the 1967 borders and they don't understand that any Palestinian leader, will never be able to accept less than what was offered by the UN Security Council and they can never give more. This is the line.

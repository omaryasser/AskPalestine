Professor Eyad mentioned the following in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3E6OCi4Dl8) video:

- Call for their freedom on the platforms you have access to.
- Cut the sins that we are doing. One of the main reasons for our humiliation.
- Pray for them and never underestimate praying and asking Allah to grant them victory.
- Help spread the correct narrative on social media to defend against the deception that their media agents are spreading.
- Use what's happening to clearly establish who's your enemy and who's your ally. It has been made clear who's trying to destroy and plunder other nations.
- Don't underestimate the long-term impact of whatever you can do to help them.

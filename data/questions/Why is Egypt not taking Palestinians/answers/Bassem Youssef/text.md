What you are saying is exactly what Israel wants. These are Palestinians. This is their land, and then suddenly you say, "Take them away"? They are basically being kicked out of their homes, and now another country should take them?

Europe has 44 countries—why don't they take them? The whole idea of "Arabs, you're all the same"—no, no, no. Because what will happen next? Israel will move Palestinians into Jordan. Then, "Oh Saudi, why don't you take the Jordanians?"

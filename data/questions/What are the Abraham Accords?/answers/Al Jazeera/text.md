- The three countries Bahrain, UAE, and Israel committed to peace but there were no Palestinian representatives at this event. What was shown in front of cameras in Washington was a political triumph and a normalization of regional relations that doesn't meaningfully address the injustices faced by people living in the region.
- The Arab media covered all the bases. Newspapers like UAE Khaleej Times ran a cover page greeting Israeli leaders. Religious media channels in the UAE delivered sermons on TV and online emphasizing the duty of Muslims to trust their leaders' decisions. Dubai TV, Bahrain TV, and the Israeli Channel 12 hosted a simultaneous live broadcast to mark the signing of the accords.

Normalisation is basically a diplomatic-speak for two countries having some kind of formal relationship where before there was none through things like trade deals, setting up embassies and direct flights. But not that long ago the idea of Gulf countries having cordial relations with Israel was unthinkable. Thereâ€™s been a lot of bad blood.

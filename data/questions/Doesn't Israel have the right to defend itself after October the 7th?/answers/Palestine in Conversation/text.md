**Doesn’t Israel have a right to defend itself?**

**Short:**  The Israeli state had the right to defend its people from the militants who attacked as it was happening on Oct. 7th. But that was a one-day event; they can't then follow that by spending an indefinite amount of time massacring Palestinian civilians as revenge. Plus, under international law, the Israeli government actually has a responsibility to protect civilians under its occupation, meaning Palestinians. The Israeli government declaring war on the same territory it occupies is not just contradictory, it leaves Palestinians doubly vulnerable because they are occupied and then attacked under occupation by those occupiers. The Israeli government does not have a right, morally or legally to do either of those things. The International Court of Justice has actually rejected Israel's interpretation of the right to self-defence, stating that attacks on Israel by Palestinians do not meet the criteria for invoking Article 51 of the UN Charter. The ongoing double standard in the Palestine/Israel ‘conflict’ is obvious when we start justifying Israeli violence while condemning any Palestinian response. Regardless of where you stand, it should be clear that self-defence doesn’t include killing children, bombing hospitals, bombing aid trucks, bombing schools and refugee camps, cutting off food and water and displacing millions of people. 

**Long:** The Israeli state had the right to defend its people from the militants who attacked as it was happening on Oct. 7th. But that was a one-day event; they can't then follow that by spending an indefinite amount of time massacring Palestinian civilians as revenge. As the occupying power of the Palestinian territories, the Israeli government has an obligation to protect the civilians under its occupation. So it cannot simultaneously occupy the territory, thus taking over the self-governing powers that would otherwise belong to Palestinians, and then declaring war upon them.

These contradictory policies (occupying land and then declaring war on it) make the Palestinian population even more vulnerable. The unstable and unsafe conditions Palestinians suffer are Israel's responsibility. Israel argues that it can invoke the right to self-defence under international law as defined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The International Court of Justice, however, rejected this. The ICJ explained that an armed attack that would trigger Article 51 must be attributable to a sovereign state - but the armed attacks by Palestinians emerge from a land which Israel controls. While Israel does have the right to defend itself against rocket attacks, it must do so in accordance with occupation law which balances military advantage, civilian suffering and proportionality. We can see that morally and legally, it is doing none of those things.

The basic double standard of the Palestine/Israel ‘conflict’ is also that any Palestinian violence justifies any Israeli violence, but no Israeli violence ever justifies any Palestinian violence. Even if you believe Israel is ‘defending’ itself after the Hamas attacks, what do you think defence looks like? Is defence collectively punishing a population of more than 2 million people, publicly calling for genocide, cutting off food, water, and power, and indiscriminately bombing them self defence? Do these really seem like the actions of a state defending itself, or is there perhaps more going on?

This is not a particularly complicated situation right now, the Israeli government has openly unabashedly blatantly declared a war of genocide on the people of Gaza, that's not an exaggerated language. The prime minister of Israel [said](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231029-netanyahu-declares-holy-war-against-gaza-citing-the-bible/) in a speech which been which has been reproduced everywhere said this is a war against [Amalek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalek) referring to the Old Testament. What's a war against Amalek? well, just open up the Old Testament. It obliges Israel to kill every man, woman, and child. Can there be any doubt, now I mean this seriously, can there be any doubt in the minds of any objective observer when Israel declares a policy of prohibiting any food water, fuel or electricity from entering Gaza that it's a genocide?

Why do they do that? Because Gaza for Israel has always been a problem. Because they refuse to just languish and die in a concentration camp. The famous expression: wherever there's oppression there's resistance, so periodically there is resistance and Israel [mows the lawn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/05/14/israel-gaza-history/) but after October 7th, it decided, number one this was obviously a resistance of a much higher magnitude and also it was an opportunity to solve the Gaza question. During the first week, and we're not talking about ancient history, they were hoping to expel all the Palestinians to Egypt and ethnic cleansing just clean out Gaza that was the goal it didn't work.

**If Hamas knew Israel was going to retaliate, why did they attack in the first place?**

**Short:** The Palestinians, particularly those in Gaza, have endured this ‘war’ for decades. Efforts for peace, such as the Oslo Peace Accord in 1993, was not adhered to at all by the Israeli government, and the situation has worsened over time with continued Israeli occupation, settlement expansion, and restrictions on Palestinian life. Peaceful initiatives, like the March of Return in 2018, were met with lethal force from Israeli snipers, causing hundreds of casualties and injuring 36,000 innocent people. The Gaza Strip has been declared 'unlivable' even prior to this current genocide by the WHO due to the quality of life that is being imposed on Palestinians by the Israeli occupation. It's also crucial to understand that the reason for the recent Hamas attack was to take live hostages in order to negotiate the release of thousands of illegally imprisoned Palestinians, not to instigate harm to their own people or eradicate all Israelis and Jews.

**Long:** This 'war' has been going on for decades. The PLO (the governing body at the time) accepted all US and Israeli conditions for peace and signed the Oslo Peace Accord in 1993, in return for an end to Israeli occupation. 30 years have passed, and the Palestinians regained nothing. Israel actually ended up occupying more land, built more settlements, increased its military presence, and violated holy sites. Palestinians have tried to resist peacefully, they've tried everything. Each time it has only resulted in more and more deaths of the Palestinian people and stricter restrictions on their daily life, movements and access to resources.

In fact, in 2018 Palestinians in Gaza launched a peaceful initiative called the March of Return by walking to the Israeli military fence surrounding Gaza demanding an end to the suffocating blockade. Israeli snipers responded by killing hundreds of marchers, ¼ of them children and injuring over 36,000. For the Palestinians, peace treaties and peaceful marches have only exacerbated their loss and perpetuated their suffering. The current state of affairs for the past 75 years, particularly in the last 16 years, have rendered Gaza ‘unlivable’ according to the WHO. Finally, it's important to understand that the purpose of the Hamas attack was to take live hostages in order to facilitate the release of 10,000 illegally imprisoned Palestinian men, women and children - not to incite the destruction of their own people, nor the eradication of all Israelis.

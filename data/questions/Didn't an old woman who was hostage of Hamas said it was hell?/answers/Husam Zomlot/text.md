While good on you that you mention these hostages and good that they are released they should be released I mean the Israeli hostages but why didn't you ask me about the Palestinian hostages the children that have been released that have been in Israeli prisons before the 7th of October you know we have hundreds of Palestinian children being grounded by Israel over years and years without charge without trial without access to lawyer or their own families and parents this is really unconscionable it doesn't even belong to our today and our humanity and there for this is a time to really focus on the overall system of Oppression.

I'll really tell you what's the difference; the difference is the first is done by individuals but the second is done by a state that sponsored an army the arm invades innocent people's houses in the middle of the night in the early hours of the morning wake up these children in the most terrifying way. It is disgraceful to even draw any Equity between a state that is a member of the UN that is Israel and its responsibility under international law and between individuals. So in fact the the lack of equity is to focus on "responsible" actions that they should perform in full accordance with international law.

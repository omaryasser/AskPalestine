[Dr. Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti) said in [this](https://youtu.be/F6_cheSL29I?si=_WyrKha38UR0-tEv&t=1245) video:

It was on the 21st of March 1968. It was a great victory because the Arabs were out of a great defeat by Israel when the three Arab states were defeated in six days. By the way, what the occupation army lost in confronting the resistance in Gaza in the current war (2024) is more than they lost in the 1967 war, which made them occupy three times the area of the Israeli entity.

That is because back then in 1967, there was no real battle. It was shocking, of course, how Israel was able to defeat three Arab armies. They used deception and many methods, but they succeeded in this aggression and created a new reality which guaranteed the occupation of Sinai, the wrath of the Golan Heights, and of course all of the West Bank and Gaza.

Then in 1968, there was a deep feeling of defeat and anger and the resistance movement began to grow. Although the Fatah movement began in the 1950s and its first operations were carried out earlier but the transformation took place in the battle of Al-Karama, because it was the first battle in which the Palestinian and Jordanian sides defeated Israel. A year later, Yasser Arafat was elected president of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.

The spokesman said: "Nations are not easily liberated. The Russians sacrificed 30 million people in World War 2 to liberate it from Hitler's attack. The Vietnamese sacrificed 3.5 million people until they defeated the Americans. Afghanistan sacrificed millions of Martyrs to defeat the USSR and then the US. The Algerian people sacrificed 6 million Martyrs over 130 years. The Palestinian people are just like any other nation. No nation is liberated without sacrifices."

I interpret that as a factual account of historical events. He's correct. It took 27 million Russian people's lives just to defeat the Nazis. Does that mean that Stalin or any of the Soviet leaders was indifferent to the deaths of their people? Does it mean that the Vietnamese leadership was indifferent? The fact that he's saying that Hamas can't resist because large numbers of people are going to die is in effect to say the Russians shouldn't have resisted the Nazis, the Vietnamese shouldn't have resisted the Americans. A lot of people are going to die. That's just a factual reality but it doesn't follow from that that Zalinski is indifferent to the deaths of Ukranians in the course of the war.

Because it is not controlled by them. The 75 year long Israeli occupation of Gaza, with increasingly strict sanctions since Hamas came into power, means that the state of Israel entirely controls Palestinians water, fuel, food, medicine, electricity, imports, exports, fishing rights, and all human movement inside and out of the territory and it encircles it militarily. Currently Israel is committing war crimes by shutting off electricity, water and fuel. As a result 95% of the water in Palestine is currently contaminated. In normal circumstances, the citizens of occupied Palestine are still only given access to electricity for less than 12 hours a day.

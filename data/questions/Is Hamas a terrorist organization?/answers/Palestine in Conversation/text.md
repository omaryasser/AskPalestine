**Short:** No. Hamas is not even declared as a terrorist group by the UN. It is recognized as a political organisation with a resistance armed branch, acknowledged by the UN for its right to resist illegal occupation. The group, democratically elected in 2006, faces tightening restrictions imposed by Israel, which are responsible for the current Palestinian humanitarian crisis. Hamas is labelled a terrorist organisation by Israel and some Western nations for their political gain, even though Hamas’ goal is to liberate Palestinians from a 75-year-long illegal occupation. The claim that they are a terrorist group makes even less sense when we understand that their creation was [backed and funded by Israel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzCta6sIABF). Regardless of what you want to believe about Hamas, the root issue is the fact that Palestinians aren’t free - a right that every one of us deserves. We also need to understand that people growing up under violent restrictions are always going to be radicalised and fight for their lives. Ending the occupation is the best and most humanitarian way to truly eradicate Hamas (if that is your ultimate goal).

**Long:** No. The UN has also actually never declared Hamas to be a terrorist group. They are a political organisation with an armed branch of Resistance Fighters, who have been given the right by the UN "to resist the illegal occupation by any means necessary." Hamas is a legitimate resistance group according to international law because they are made up of an occupied people.

Hamas was elected democratically in 2006, but Palestinians have yet to experience a moment of independence. Israel immediately imposed massive restrictions upon Palestinians in the Gaza Strip when Hamas won the elections, and has been tightening them ever since. These restrictions have created an ongoing  "humanitarian catastrophe". Even prior to October 7, these restrictions have meant that Palestinians have had limited to no access to clean water, electricity or the ability to tend to even the most urgent medical needs.

The narrative that Hamas is a terrorist organisation came from the Israeli government and other Western nations and only began once Hamas won the election. It also makes it even more clear this labelling was done for political gain when you understand that Israel funded and helped create Hamas. In fact, Wikileaks revealed that the Israeli Intelligence Chief [said](https://www.jpost.com/defense/yadlin-israel-would-be-happy-if-hamas-takes-over-gaza) that the IDF could deal with Gaza as a hostile state if Hamas ruled. And for 14 years, it has been Netanyhu’s policy to keep Hamas in power. Hamas has actually never threatened to attack any other nation. Their focus is solely on getting their freedom and land back from illegal occupiers and they have every legitimate right to do so.

If Hamas was a terrorist group it would just be a terrorist group. They would promote terror, not liberation. We also need to understand that people growing up under a blockade are going to be radicalised and fight violently for their lives. Even if the goal still remains to ‘eradicate Hamas’, we need to first eradicate the occupation. That is the most humane solution for everyone involved and gives Palestinians back their freedom - a right we all deserve.

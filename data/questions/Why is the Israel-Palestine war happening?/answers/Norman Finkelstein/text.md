What did you expect the people of Gaza to do after being incarcerated in a concentration camp for 20 years? I know what you wanted them to do. You wanted them to just languish and die but did you not really expect that if they had the opportunity or made the opportunity that they would attempt to do something. Then there's the logic, if you look at World War 2, everytime the partisans, the resistance, killed a major Nazi officer, the Nazis retaliated in very bloody ways. The most famous of the killings was when the Czech partisans killed [Reinhard Heydrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich). What did the Nazis do? they went into the village of [Lidice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidice) and flattened it and killed every male above the age of 14. There come [Jack Tapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper) from radio berlin and he [says](https://www.israelunwired.com/cnn-anchor-finally-gets-it-right-on-israel-and-hamas/#:~:text=pro%2DHamas%20spokesmen%2C%20%E2%80%9C-,What%20did%20you%20expect,-%3F%E2%80%9D) What did you expect the Nazis to do? They killed Reinhard Heydrich! What did you expect them to do? The logic of his argument is the people of Gaza should do nothing. Because if they do anything, Israel is going to retaliate. What did you expect them to do?

The people of Gaza in the beginning of March 30th 2018, they tried nonviolence. They marched non-violently to the fence. What did Israel do? It targeted children, targeted Medics, targeted journalists, targeted people with physical disabilities, people on crutches and in wheelchairs and then comes Jake Tapper, well they were approaching the fence in Gaza, what did you expect the Israelis to do? That's his logic. The logic is, they should do nothing. They should just languish and die because if they do anything, what do you expect Israel to do!

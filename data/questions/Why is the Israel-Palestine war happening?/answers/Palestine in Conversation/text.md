**Short:** The Hamas charter explicitly states that their war is against Zionism, the occupation, and the settler colonial project, not the Jewish people. The claim that "Hamas wants to kill all Jews" is misleading and pits together two unrelated concepts. Hamas is fighting for the liberation of the Palestinian people and an end to the occupation, not the eradication of Jews. They have also agreed to a two-state solution, which Israel rejected. The narrative suggesting otherwise is used for political gain and to justify genocide under the claim of eradicating a 'terrorist' group.

**Long:** The Hamas charter explicitly states that they have no problem with the Jewish people. They also clearly state that their war is against Zionism, the occupation, and the settler colonial project. It’s also important to understand that settler-colonialism is a dynamic of power and resources, and is the reality of the situation, not just a justification being used by Hamas to ‘kill all the Jews’. Israel is a settler colony because its creation necessitated the violent displacement of the land's inhabitants and in order to exist, it must perpetually police and populate stolen homes to maintain power, as well as eradicate those that stand in their way.

The “Hamas wants to kill all Jews” argument is also similar to the one that states it is anti-semitic to be anti-zionist, in that it is falsely equating two unrelated concepts. Hamas wanting liberation for the Palestinian people, and the end to the occupation so they can live freely and rightfully on their own land, is not equivalent to calling for the death of all Jews - in theory nor in their own writings. Hamas has also agreed to a two-state solution, which Israel rejected. This narrative is perpetuated for political gain, and to justify genocide in the name of eradicating a ‘terrorist’ group.

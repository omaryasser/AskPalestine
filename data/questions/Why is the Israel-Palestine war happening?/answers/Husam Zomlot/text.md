This is really a sort of snapshot of this situation. Palestinian-Israeli conflict was not caused by Hamas or any other group. It's 100 years of conflict it's the conflict that caused and created all these Palestinian political and militant groups all through our history and perhaps the world needs to, particularly the US, go straight to the root cause of all this which is the illegal military occupation this is not an issue between Arabs and Arabs or Palestinians and Palestinians this is an issue with Israel's 56 years of occupation and 75 years of Nakba and ethnic cleansing and that's why you have the situation we have today and we need to go straightaway to the root cause.

Some of the points written by the [Middle East Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) in [this](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210819-the-massacre-of-jews-in-1929-hebron-is-a-microcosm-of-the-conflict/) article:

- On that fateful day in August 1929, Arab-Palestinians in Jerusalem were incited to violence by rumours that Jews were planning to appropriate what is known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary of Al-Aqsa and destroy the mosques there. The late Israeli historian Haim Gerber pointed out that in numerous documents written by Zionist leaders in the late 1920s they expressed the will to demolish the buildings on the “Temple Mount” to make space for a new Jewish Temple.
- While the spark of the Hebron massacre – part of the so-called 1929 Palestine riots, in which a total of **133** Jews and **116** Arabs were killed – is indeed linked to Jerusalem, the deeper roots are to be found in Hebron itself, where Arabs and Jews had lived together for centuries without any particular tension, and often spoke the same language. The most notable exception to this was in 1775, when members of Hebron’s Jewish community were unjustly accused of having killed the son of a local sheikh and were obliged to pay a heavy fine.

Professor [Naom Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) has mentioned in [this](https://youtu.be/cXhqgsZ7ZRc?si=jZEeBogDOgwKnfbR&t=1463) video:

If you take a look at the Geneva Accords, you can occasionally find something looking like a map which is a considerable improvement over the [Taba proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba_Summit) which was itself a very substantial improvement over Camp David. Is the Geneva Accords just? No, because Israel
abandons nothing of its territory, to be precise, it abandons a little strip of its territory along the Gaza Strip which is not very important and in return, it takes over a  piece of the West Bank but it abandons nothing and crucially, a large section of the Palestinians were not
represented as part of these negotiations and their rights were essentially dismissed.

[This video by المُخبر الاقتصادي+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JxhtJaXKhU) explains how humanitarian aid is now controlled by Israel as a means of facilitating the displacement of Palestinians from their land. Key points discussed in the video include:

* Humanitarian aid is tied to a significant Israeli-American conspiracy against Gazans.
* Former U.S. President Donald Trump proposed the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in February 2025, a plan later pursued by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
* Netanyahu instructed the [Mossad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad) to identify countries willing to accept Gazans. According to Axios, Mossad found Indonesia, Libya, and Ethiopia as potential destinations ([Axios, July 18, 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/israel-send-palestinians-gaza-indonesia-ethiopia)).
* In December 2023, shortly after the onset of Israeli aggression in Gaza, a group of Israeli officers and businessmen convened at a school in Israel under the name "Mikveh Yisrael Forum" to discuss plans for controlling aid distribution in Gaza. Their proposal involved using private contractors to distribute aid and sidelining international organizations, including the United Nations.
* Philip F. Reilly, a former senior CIA officer, emerged as a key partner in Israel's plan to control aid distribution ([New York Times, May 24, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html)).
* Reilly, while working for Orbis in late 2024, developed a detailed study on delivering aid in Gaza through private companies and external institutions, as revealed by internal Orbis documents reviewed by the New York Times.
* In November 2024, Reilly's legal representative established two companies—Safe Reach Solutions and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation—later involved in aid distribution in Gaza.
* By October 2024, Reilly collaborated with the Boston Consulting Group to develop "Project Aurora," aimed at controlling aid distribution and facilitating the displacement of Palestinians ([Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ex-cia-paramilitary-running-gaza-security-advised-boston-consulting-group)).
* In May 2025, Safe Reach Solutions became the primary entity responsible for securing aid distribution centers established by the Israeli army in Gaza, effectively marginalizing international organizations.
* Safe Reach Solutions was implicated in daily violence against Palestinians waiting for aid at distribution centers managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, including incidents of live ammunition targeting civilians.
* In April 2025, the Boston Consulting Group worked on a separate study analyzing the costs of displacing Palestinians and the future of Gaza in the post-war phase ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c0e661cc-55db-4e2a-b17b-a656e0cf6c14)).

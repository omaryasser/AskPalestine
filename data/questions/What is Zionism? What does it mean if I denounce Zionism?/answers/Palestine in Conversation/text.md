**What is Zionism?**

Zionism is a political and ideological movement that emerged in the late 19th century, advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The term is derived from "Zion," a biblical reference to Jerusalem. The Zionist movement gained momentum in response to increasing anti-Semitism in Europe. The most notable event was the publication of "Theodor Herzl's" book "Der Judenstaat" ("The Jewish State") in 1896, where he called for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. Zionism led to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, and the subsequent Nakba in which 800,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced, 15,000 violently killed and thousands more maimed, raped, imprisoned, abused and tortured.

**What does it mean if I denounce Zionism?**

It means opposing the political ideology of Zionism, which has resulted in the expulsion of millions of Indigenous Palestinians from their land and homes. It means standing against the creation of a nation-state with exclusive rights for Jews above others on the land. Anti-Zionism supports liberation and justice for the Palestinian people, including their right to return to their homes and land. Anti-Zionists believe in a future where all people on the land live in freedom, safety and equality. Opposition to the political movement of Zionism and/or the policies of the state of Israel is no different from criticism of any other political ideology or policies of any other nation-state.

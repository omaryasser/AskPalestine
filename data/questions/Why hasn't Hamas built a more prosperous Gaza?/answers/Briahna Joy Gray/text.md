Israel is already saying that zones that are supposed to be safe zones for civilians are not in fact civilian zones and that they have been infiltrated by Hamas, that's hospitals, that's camps, schools, refugee camps and the like. So why should anybody take their word for the idea that if there were a bomb shelter, it too wouldn't become a target under the justification that Hamas is using the bomb shelter?

You are a very stylish revolutionary Staff Software Engineer who's building a website to help the Palestinian case. Mainly, you are trying to fill the gap for people who still didn't make their mind on Palestine-related debate topic by presenting them all the answers that were answered by prominent pro-palestinians before about the questions they want to ask.

# AskPalestine

## Goal
The website is like an index of Palestine-related questions and answers to those questions by pro-palestinian prominent figures that are well known on the internet. It's not easy to find the right words when questions come. That's why we built AskPalestine. It is for every pro-Palestinian and for every one who still didn't make their mind to read and share answers that show the truth while not falling into the traps of misleading narratives. AskPalestine is there to give you the strength to speak up with confidence.

## Website Description
### Home Page
* The main use case is that a user will get to the home page of the application and will be prompted to ask any question they want about Palestine and then the related questions will be listed to them along with the answers.
* It will be good to give an intro about the reason behind the website or what it's purpose in the home page.
* It will be good to show the list or photos of the figures that we captured their answers just as a teaser or something that makes people feel they want to check the website.

### Questions Page
* The route can be /questions/<question>
* This will show a particular question along with the list of answers that received for it.
* Allow users to press a button to share / copy the question link or a link that take them to a particular answer for a question, perhaps in the same page in which all answers are shown.
* Allow users to report a particular answer to a question if they think the information is false or something.

### Pro-palestinians page
* The route can be /pro-palestinians/<username>
* This will show the bio of one of the figures that we record the answers for as well as a list of the questions they answered along with the answers.

### Social Media
The website has the following social media websites:
* https://www.facebook.com/askpalestineinfo
* https://x.com/askpalestine_qa
* https://www.instagram.com/askpalestineinfo/

### Icon
* The icon for the website is in public/favicon.png

## Design Decisions
* The app is in NextJs app router.
* At build time, the data/ folder should be read and the website pages should be created.
    * The data/ folder has under it questions/ and pro-palestinians/ folders
    * The questions/ folder has under it a folder named after each question (e.g. Are Israelâ€™s recent peace agreements with several Arab countries a step in the right direction?). That should be a link for a page on the website.
        * Under each question there's text.md with the question and metadata.json about the question.
    * Under pro-palestinians/ folder there's a folder for each one of the prominent figures.
        * Under each, there's bio.md and photo
* When the server starts, it should create an sqlite database that saves all the questions along with their vector embeddings
* The embeddings should be getten from https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings using their text-embedding-3-small model and the OpenAI API key should be expected in an OPEN_AI_API_KEY env variable.
* These embeddings are saved in sqlite so that when the user ask for a question, we get to them the most related questions sorted
* We initially show the most related 5 and the user can ask for more.
* Only add comments in the code for when the code is really complex but dont' add a lot of comments as I don't like that.
* Feedback will be sent to an app script link that adds things to Google sheet. I created the script and everything, only thing needed is to submit the users feedback using the following link and json format: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzkz3WDW6cyZAf0Zew1gNvMiH8bHIdN_P3QpI-YPFUMjLhKWHh3AtYPS3TnAC6F_QBf6Q/exec.
{
  "question": "Wheree is Hamas?",
  "answer": "It is in Palestine",
  "feedback": "Is that accurate?"
}
* In questions metadata the source type may be recorded the source type. For now, there's either null or YOUTUBTE. If it's youtube, embed the source video.

## Styling
* Colors
  * The panel should be palestine flag related, so #006234 (green), #fe3233 (red), and black
  * The design should be responsive for it to work on a phone as well
  * The background can be #dfd5ca
